problem statement: 

Development of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Tropical Cyclone intensity estimation using half-hourly INSAT-3D IR Images and development of a web application for visualization of the imagery.


satellite: INSAT3D/3DR

image interval: 15min

required images: instantaneous structural changes during evolution, intensification, and landfall of Tropical Cyclones.

dataset image year duration: 
Datasets of Cyclones captured by INSAT-3D over the Indian Oceans are available since 2014
